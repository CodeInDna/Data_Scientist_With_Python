# t-SNE for 2-Dimensional Maps
# t=SNE = "t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding"

# t-SNE visualization of grain dataset
# In the video, you saw t-SNE applied to the iris dataset. In this exercise, you'll apply t-SNE to the grain samples data and inspect the resulting t-SNE features using a scatter plot. You are given an array samples of grain samples and a list variety_numbers giving the variety number of each grain sample.
# Import TSNE
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE

# Create a TSNE instance: model
model = TSNE(learning_rate=200)

# Apply fit_transform to samples: tsne_features
tsne_features = model.fit_transform(samples)

# Select the 0th feature: xs
xs = tsne_features[:,0]

# Select the 1st feature: ys
ys = tsne_features[:,1]

# Scatter plot, coloring by variety_numbers
plt.scatter(xs,ys,c=variety_numbers)
plt.show()

# A t-SNE map of the stock market
# t-SNE provides great visualizations when the individual samples can be labeled. In this exercise, you'll apply t-SNE to the company stock price data. A scatter plot of the resulting t-SNE features, labeled by the company names, gives you a map of the stock market! The stock price movements for each company are available as the array normalized_movements (these have already been normalized for you). The list companies gives the name of each company. PyPlot (plt) has been imported for you.
# Import TSNE
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE

# Create a TSNE instance: model
model = TSNE(learning_rate=50)

# Apply fit_transform to normalized_movements: tsne_features
tsne_features = model.fit_transform(normalized_movements)

# Select the 0th feature: xs
xs = tsne_features[:,0]

# Select the 1th feature: ys
ys = tsne_features[:,1]

# Scatter plot
plt.scatter(xs, ys, alpha=0.5)

# Annotate the points
for x, y, company in zip(xs, ys, companies):
    plt.annotate(company, (x, y), fontsize=5, alpha=0.75)
plt.show()
# It's visualizations such as this that make t-SNE such a powerful tool for extracting quick insights from high dimensional data.
