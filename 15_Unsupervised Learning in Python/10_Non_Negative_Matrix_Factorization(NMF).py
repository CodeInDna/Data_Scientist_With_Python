# NMF applied to Wikipedia articles
# In the video, you saw NMF applied to transform a toy word-frequency array. Now it's your turn to apply NMF, this time using the tf-idf word-frequency array of Wikipedia articles, given as a csr matrix articles. Here, fit the model and transform the articles. In the next exercise, you'll explore the result.

# Import NMF
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF

# Create an NMF instance: model
model = NMF(n_components=6)

# Fit the model to articles
model.fit(articles)

# Transform the articles: nmf_features
nmf_features = model.transform(articles)

# Print the NMF features
print(nmf_features)

# NMF features of the Wikipedia articles
# Now you will explore the NMF features you created in the previous exercise. A solution to the previous exercise has been pre-loaded, so the array nmf_features is available. Also available is a list titles giving the title of each Wikipedia article.

# When investigating the features, notice that for both actors, the NMF feature 3 has by far the highest value. This means that both articles are reconstructed using mainly the 3rd NMF component. In the next video, you'll see why: NMF components represent topics (for instance, acting!).
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Create a pandas DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(nmf_features,index=titles)

# Print the row for 'Anne Hathaway'
print(df.loc['Anne Hathaway'])

# Print the row for 'Denzel Washington'
print(df.loc['Denzel Washington'])
