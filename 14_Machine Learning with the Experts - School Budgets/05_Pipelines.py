# Instantiate pipeline
# In order to make your life easier as you start to work with all of the data in your original DataFrame, df, it's time to turn to one of scikit-learn's most useful objects: the Pipeline.

# For the next few exercises, you'll reacquaint yourself with pipelines and train a classifier on some synthetic (sample) data of multiple datatypes before using the same techniques on the main dataset.

# The sample data is stored in the DataFrame, sample_df, which has three kinds of feature data: numeric, text, and numeric with missing values. It also has a label column with two classes, a and b.

# In this exercise, your job is to instantiate a pipeline that trains using the numeric column of the sample data.

# Import Pipeline
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Import other necessary modules
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier

# Split and select numeric data only, no nans 
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(sample_df[['numeric']],
                                                    pd.get_dummies(sample_df['label']), 
                                                    random_state=22)

# Instantiate Pipeline object: pl
pl = Pipeline([
        ('clf', OneVsRestClassifier(LogisticRegression()))
    ])

# Fit the pipeline to the training data
pl.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Compute and print accuracy
accuracy = pl.score(X_test, y_test)
print("\nAccuracy on sample data - numeric, no nans: ", accuracy) # Accuracy on sample data - numeric, no nans:  0.62
# Now it's time to incorporate numeric data with missing values by adding a preprocessing step!

# Preprocessing numeric features
# What would have happened if you had included the with 'with_missing' column in the last exercise? Without imputing missing values, the pipeline would not be happy (try it and see). So, in this exercise you'll improve your pipeline a bit by using the Imputer() imputation transformer from scikit-learn to fill in missing values in your sample data.

# By default, the imputer transformer replaces NaNs with the mean value of the column. That's a good enough imputation strategy for the sample data, so you won't need to pass anything extra to the imputer.

# After importing the transformer, you will edit the steps list used in the previous exercise by inserting a (name, transform) tuple. Recall that steps are processed sequentially, so make sure the new tuple encoding your preprocessing step is put in the right place.

# The sample_df is in the workspace, in case you'd like to take another look. Make sure to select both numeric columns- in the previous exercise we couldn't use with_missing because we had no preprocessing step!

# Import the Imputer object
from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer

# Create training and test sets using only numeric data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(sample_df[['numeric', 'with_missing']],
                                                    pd.get_dummies(sample_df['label']), 
                                                    random_state=456)

# Insantiate Pipeline object: pl
pl = Pipeline([
        ('imp', Imputer()),
        ('clf', OneVsRestClassifier(LogisticRegression()))
    ])

# Fit the pipeline to the training data
pl.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Compute and print accuracy
accuracy = pl.score(X_test,y_test)
print("\nAccuracy on sample data - all numeric, incl nans: ", accuracy) # Accuracy on sample data - all numeric, incl nans:  0.636
# Now you know how to use preprocessing in pipelines with numeric data, and it looks like the accuracy has improved because of it! Text data preprocessing is next!
