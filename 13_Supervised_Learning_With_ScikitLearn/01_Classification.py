# Supervised_Learning
# What is Machine Learning ?
# The art and science of:
	# Giving computers the ability to learn to make decisions from data
	# Without being explicitly programmed !
# Examples:
	# Learning to predict whether an email is spam or not
	# Clustering wikipedia entries into different categories
# Supervised Learning: Uses Labelled Data
# Unsupervised Learning: Uses UnLabelled Data
# 
# Unsupervised learning: Uncovering hidden patterns from unlabeled data
# Example:
	# Grouping customers into distinct categories (Clustering)
#
# Reinforcement Learning
# Software Agents interact with an environment
	# Learn how to optimize their behavior
	# Given a system of rewards and punishments
	# Draws inspiration from behavioral psychology
# Applications
	# Economics
	# Genetics
	# Game Playing
# AlphaGo: First Computer to Defeat the World Champion in Go

########### Supervised Learning ###########
# Predictor Variables/features and a target variable.
# Aim: Predict the target variable, given the predictor variables.
	# Classfication: Target Variable Consists of Categories
	# Regression: Target variable is Continuous

# NAMING CONVENTIONS
# Features = Predictor Variables = Independent Variables
# Target Variable = Dependent Variable = Response Variable

# Automate time-consuming or expensive manual tasks
	# Example: Doctor's Diagnosis

# Make Predictions about the future
	# Example: Will a customer click on an ad or not?

# Need Labeled Data
	# Historical data with labels
	# Experiments to get labeled data
	# Crowd-Sourcing Labeled Data
# Which of these is a classification problem?
# Once you decide to leverage supervised machine learning to solve a new problem, you need to identify whether your problem is better suited to classification or regression. This exercise will help you develop your intuition for distinguishing between the two.

# Provided below are 4 example applications of machine learning. Which of them is a supervised classification problem?
# Using labeled financial data to predict whether the value of a stock will go up or go down next week. <-
# Using labeled housing price data to predict the price of a new house based on various features.
# Using unlabeled data to cluster the students of an online education company into different categories based on their learning styles.
# Using labeled financial data to predict what the value of a stock will be next week.
