# The Rectified Linear Activation Function
# As Dan explained to you in the video, an "activation function" is a function applied at each node. It converts the node's input into some output.

# The rectified linear activation function (called ReLU) has been shown to lead to very high-performance networks. This function takes a single number as an input, returning 0 if the input is negative, and the input if the input is positive.

# Here are some examples:
# relu(3) = 3
# relu(-3) = 0
def relu(input):
    '''Define your relu activation function here'''
    # Calculate the value for the output of the relu function: output
    output = max(0, input)
    
    # Return the value just calculated
    return(output)

# Calculate node 0 value: node_0_output
node_0_input = (input_data * weights['node_0']).sum()
node_0_output = relu(node_0_input)

# Calculate node 1 value: node_1_output
node_1_input = (input_data * weights['node_1']).sum()
node_1_output = relu(node_1_input)

# Put node values into array: hidden_layer_outputs
hidden_layer_outputs = np.array([node_0_output, node_1_output])

# Calculate model output (do not apply relu)
model_output = (hidden_layer_outputs * weights['output']).sum()

# Print model output
print(model_output)
# You predicted 52 transactions. Without this activation function, you would have predicted a negative number! The real power of activation functions will come soon when you start tuning model weights.

# Applying the network to many observations/rows of data
# You'll now define a function called predict_with_network() which will generate predictions for multiple data observations, which are pre-loaded as input_data. As before, weights are also pre-loaded. In addition, the relu() function you defined in the previous exercise has been pre-loaded.
# Define predict_with_network()
def predict_with_network(input_data_row, weights):

    # Calculate node 0 value
    node_0_input = (input_data_row * weights['node_0']).sum()
    node_0_output = relu(node_0_input)

    # Calculate node 1 value
    node_1_input = (input_data_row * weights['node_1']).sum()
    node_1_output = relu(node_1_input)

    # Put node values into array: hidden_layer_outputs
    hidden_layer_outputs = np.array([node_0_output, node_1_output])
    
    # Calculate model output
    input_to_final_layer = (hidden_layer_outputs * weights['output']).sum()
    model_output = input_to_final_layer
    
    # Return model output
    return(model_output)


# Create empty list to store prediction results
results = []
for input_data_row in input_data:
    # Append prediction to results
    results.append(predict_with_network(input_data_row,weights))

# Print results
print(results)
# <script.py> output:
    # [52, 63, 0, 148]
