# Shortest Path I
# You can leverage what you know about finding neighbors to try finding paths in a network. One algorithm for path-finding between two nodes is the "breadth-first search" (BFS) algorithm. In a BFS algorithm, you start from a particular node and iteratively search through its neighbors and neighbors' neighbors until you find the destination node.

# Pathfinding algorithms are important because they provide another way of assessing node importance; you'll see this in a later exercise.

# In this set of 3 exercises, you're going to build up slowly to get to the final BFS algorithm. The problem has been broken into 3 parts that, if you complete in succession, will get you to a first pass implementation of the BFS algorithm.
# Define path_exists()

# Shortest Path II
# Now that you've got the code for checking whether the destination node is present in neighbors, next up, you're going to extend the same function to write the code for the condition where the destination node is not present in the neighbors.

# All the code you need to write is in the else condition; that is, if node2 is not in neighbors.
