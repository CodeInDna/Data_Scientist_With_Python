# A scatter plot with different shapes
# By calling multiple glyph functions on the same figure object, we can overlay multiple data sets in the same figure.

# In this exercise, you will plot female literacy vs fertility for two different regions, Africa and Latin America. Each set of x and y data has been loaded separately for you as fertility_africa, female_literacy_africa, fertility_latinamerica, and female_literacy_latinamerica.

# Your job is to plot the Latin America data with the circle() glyph, and the Africa data with the x() glyph.

# figure has already been imported for you from bokeh.plotting.

# Import output_file and show from bokeh.io
